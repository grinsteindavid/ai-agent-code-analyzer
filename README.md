# Autonomous Code Analyzer: AI-Powered Codebase Intelligence

## Overview

The Autonomous Code Analyzer is an AI-powered CLI tool that uses OpenAI's GPT models to analyze codebases, search for specific patterns, and perform operations on files. The system follows an agent-based architecture where the AI creates a plan, executes a series of tools according to that plan, and then summarizes the findings.

## Features

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Ask questions about your codebase in plain English
- **Intelligent Codebase Analysis**: Get insights about your code structure, patterns, and organization
- **Web Research Integration**: Search the web directly from your terminal with DuckDuckGo Lite
  - Customizable search parameters including domain-specific queries
  - Structured results with titles, URLs, and descriptions
- **File Operations**: Find files, read content, and create new files - all through conversational commands
- **Pattern Search**: Use grep-like functionality through simple queries
- **Execution Planning**: Advanced AI planning capabilities to break down complex requests into manageable steps
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add new tools and AI providers to enhance functionality
- **Markdown-Formatted Results**: Clean and readable output for improved developer experience

## System Components

### Core Components

1. **Entry Point (index.js)**
   - Initializes the CLI command structure
   - Orchestrates the overall execution flow
   - Manages the loop of function calls until completion

2. **AI Provider (OpenAI)**
   - Handles communication with OpenAI APIs
   - Implements three key functions:
     - `getPlan`: Generates an execution plan
     - `getFunctionCall`: Determines the next tool to execute
     - `getSummary`: Summarizes findings after execution

3. **Context Management (context.js)**
   - Maintains state throughout execution
   - Stores conversation history, current directory, and plan
   - Provides utility functions for state management

4. **Tools Management (tools.js)**
   - Registers available tools with their schemas and execution functions
   - Validates tool arguments against schemas
   - Handles tool execution and formatting of results

### Available Tools

1. **list_directories**: Lists files and directories in a specified path
2. **read_file_content**: Reads the content of a file
3. **grep_search**: Searches for patterns in files
4. **find_files**: Finds files matching specific patterns
5. **create_file**: Creates a new file with specified content
6. **update_file**: Updates the content of an existing file
7. **web_search**: Performs web searches using DuckDuckGo Lite

## Prompt Structure and Tool Sequence

### 1. Plan Generation

The system starts with the `getPlan` function, which uses the following prompt structure:

- **System Prompt**: Instructs the AI to create an execution plan based on:
  - Operating system info
  - Node.js version
  - Current working directory and its contents
  - Available tools and their descriptions
- **User Message**: Contains the user's query

The response is a structured plan with a goal statement and numbered steps.

### 2. Function Call Generation

The `getFunctionCall` function uses a two-stage process:

1. **First Stage (Next Thought)**:
   - System prompt contains context about directory, available tools, and instructions to follow the plan
   - Previous messages are included for context
   - Generates a "next thought" explaining what action will be taken

2. **Second Stage (Tool Selection)**:
   - Uses the next thought as guidance
   - Selects the appropriate tool and arguments
   - Returns a structured function call object

### 3. Tool Execution

Tools are executed based on their registered functions in the tools.js file:

1. Each tool has a schema for argument validation
2. The execution function is called with the provided arguments
3. Results are formatted according to each tool's formatting function
4. Results are added to the conversation history

### 4. Summary Generation

After all steps are completed, the `getSummary` function:

- Reviews the entire conversation history
- Compares actual execution against the original plan
- Generates a concise summary of findings
- Adds the summary to the conversation history

## Special Focus: Web Search Implementation

The web search tool (`web_search`) stands out as a particularly useful feature:

- Uses DuckDuckGo Lite to avoid rate limiting issues
- Parses HTML responses with Cheerio to extract structured results
- Returns search results with titles, URLs, descriptions, and display URLs
- Can be customized with a maximum number of results parameter

## System Design Principles

1. **Modular Architecture**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Stateful Context**: Maintains state throughout execution
3. **Tool Abstraction**: Tools are registered with a common interface
4. **Validation**: Arguments are validated against schemas
5. **Conversation Management**: All interactions are tracked as a conversation

## Conclusion

The Autonomous Code Analyzer demonstrates an effective architecture for AI-powered CLI tools. By separating planning, execution, and summarization into distinct phases, it provides a structured approach to solving complex code analysis tasks. The use of tool abstractions allows for easy extension with new capabilities while maintaining a consistent interface for the AI to interact with.

## Example Output

```bash

### Summary of Execution Results

1. **Reading `README.md`**: The project is an AI-powered command-line tool that employs models like OpenAI's GPT-4 to facilitate code analysis and interaction via natural language. Key features include intelligent analysis, web search capabilities, extensibility, and various file operations.

2. **Listing the `src` Directory**: The `src` directory contains the following items:
   - `index.js`: The application's main entry point.
   - `providers`: Contains different AI provider implementations.
   - `tools`: Utility files that provide specific functionalities.
   - `utils`: Utility functions and validation helpers.

3. **Finding JavaScript Files**: A total of 16 JavaScript files were identified, including files in `index.js`, `providers`, `tools`, and `utils` directories, indicating a comprehensive code structure.

4. **Searching for Key Components**: The `grep_search` tool revealed extensive use of `module.exports` across various files. This suggests that the project employs the CommonJS module syntax to structure and export functionalities effectively.

### Conclusion
The execution of the planned steps provided a thorough overview of the Autonomous Code Analyzer project. It highlights the project's capabilities as an AI-integrated tool for code analysis, the organization of its source code, and its reliance on CommonJS for modular structure. This modular architecture enhances maintainability and extensibility, aligning well with modern JavaScript development practices. The findings underscore the project’s potential in aiding developers with AI-driven insights into their codebases.
