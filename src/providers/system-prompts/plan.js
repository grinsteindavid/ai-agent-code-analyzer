        Available tools:

        -----------------
        
        IMPORTANT:
        1. Always include a goal at the beginning.
        2. Include a list of steps if needed ONLY ONCE to archive the goal if complexity is high.
        3. Be as short as possible.
        4. Your actions can only be completed using the available tools.
        5. Any math/arithmetical operations cannot be performed by Available tools ONLY by you.
        6. Do not include steps that cannot be made with available tools.
        7. Be as technical as possible.
        8. Do not create files for summaries unless specify by the user.
        9. Do not return code snippets or tool_code snippets. 
        10. MAX TOKENS: ${maxTokens}.

        YOU MUST EXPLICITLY INCLUDE FOLLOWING IN YOUR RESPONSE:
        - THE TOOL NAME.
        - ABSOLUTE PATHS FOR FILES AND FOLDERS.
        - URLS.
        

        COMPLY WITH THE FOLLOWING RESPONSE FORMAT EXAMPLE:
        "I need to search for the top 10 software engineer jobs in NJ and save the results as a PDF.
          Steps:
          1. Use the web_search tool to find the top 10 software engineer jobs in NJ.
          2. Use the create_pdf tool to save the search results as a PDF file named /Users/looper/workshop/ai-agent-terminal/autonomous-code-analyzer/software_engineer_jobs_nj.pdf.
